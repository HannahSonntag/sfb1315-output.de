During the SFb1315 retreat, we had a 45 minute presentation of the smartFigure gallery concept and tool. The hands-on session that was planned had to be cut for both timing (1h was initially planned)
and technical (no stable internet connection) reasons.

We distributed the researchers in three groups, and Julien Colomb, Hanna Sonntag and Thomas Lemberger gave three different but similar presentation of the tool, and gather feedback from the researchers during the last 5-10 minutes of the presentation. Here we report that feedback,

## New scenario: reporting null and problematic results

In the present publish or perish scientific communication system, there is no room for critical presentation of one own's results or tool. Presenting difficult results in the SmartFigure gallery might become a way to share knowledge about non-published difficulties and present puzzling results to get feedback inside the SFB. Indeed, someone in the consortium might well know of technical insights that explain the results.

One can also imagine to be able to seamlessly publish these results in micropublication, if they do not fit in the bigger picture.

## Publication of SmartFigure

After discussion, the implementation of these elements will be postponed to a later time point. We will need to think about:

- New version for publication (cleaner)
- How to license the work
- Getting a PID (doi)
- Combine panels into one figure *
- Combine metadata *

* may be taken up by the texture project.

## Usage, upload

- accessibility to the lab only
- use mathematical equation in the caption (markdown)
- timestamp
- new version, copy metadata in new SmartFigures

## Usage, read

- Getting summary emails (as no one will go every day on the platform)
- Get a narative !!
- Filter and sort the SmartFigure to get the relevant one first.
- Following people, figures or groups

## Other

- PID
- Better commenting (external tool / support for email like on GitHub)
- Different type of figures (drawn, data analysis, model, visual abstract, whiteboards, ...)
- Decentralisation.
